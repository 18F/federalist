### Setting up environment variables

1. Make a copy of `admin-client/sample.env` and name it `.env` and place it in the `config` folder. You can do this by running `cp admin/{sample,}.env`
1. Update the variable for `GITHUB_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` for local development using the same id as you [API config](../README.md#editing-the-local-configuration-file)
